Steps to solve:

1. Use 2 pointers, i and j. i is fast and j is slow.
2. Take substring from j to i. For ex, substring 4 till 7.
3. Whenever we find any word that is the dict, we check if the word till 4 was found. If yes, we mark 7 as also found.
4. Using DP we take small chunks of the substrings and mark true if found, so that all substrings from that point onwards can reference this.
5. Finally, we check index in the found vector and return.
